General Green
Version 0.1

== Theme Description ==

A two column theme based on the theme General from Templatemo (http://www.templatemo.com).
This theme features HTML5 markup, HTML5 Shiv has been added for compatibility with Internet Explorer 8.

== Install Instructions ==

Extract the archive and copy the contents to the directory "theme" in your GetSimple installation. 

Activate it with the admin panel (http://yoursite/admin) under "Theme".


== Troubleshooting ==

=== The doesn't doesn't look good in Internet Explorer ===

To view this theme under older versions of Internet Explorer, you need to enable Javascript.
Despite noticing a few degradation (such as shadows not showing), the content are expected to remain fully functionnal.

Internet Explorer 6 however will remain unsupported. If you need full support I recommend checkint the available choice
from the GetSimple website (http://get-simple.info/extend/all_themes.php) and try a non HTML5 theme.
